3. Monitor your spaceship's hull integrity and retreat if it gets too low.
4. Try to defeat as many aliens as possible while preserving your spaceship's health.

## Game Logic

- Aliens have random armor and accuracy.
- Your spaceship has a chance to hit the alien based on accuracy.
- Aliens attack you at the same time you attack them
- When you attack, the alien's hull decreases.
- When the alien's hull reaches zero, it is defeated.
- If your spaceship's hull reaches zero, the game ends.
- To win you need to destroy all aliens

## Sound

The game includes a laser attack sound effect for added immersion.
